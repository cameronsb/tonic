# Piano Redesign - Progress Summary
**Date:** November 2, 2025  
**Commit:** e57b97e

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Completed Tasks (3 of 8 from OVERVIEW_PLAN.md)

1. **CRITICAL - Data Model Foundation** ✅
   - Created proper `Song` interface as single source of truth
   - Defined `ChordBlock`, `MelodyNote`, `DrumPattern` types
   - Refactored state from flat structure to `Song.tracks.chords.blocks`
   - All components now use clean data model

2. **CRITICAL - Grid System** ✅
   - Built `useGrid()` hook with all conversion utilities
   - Pixel ↔ Time conversions (8th notes as base unit)
   - Snap-to-grid functionality
   - Created `Ruler` component showing measures and beats
   - All positioning uses grid calculations

3. **HIGH - Grid-Based ChordTimeline** ✅
   - Rebuilt from list-view to positioned blocks
   - Visual timeline with measure grid background
   - **Drag-to-move**: Drag chords to any position (snaps to 8th notes)
   - **Shift+Drag to reorder**: Changes sequence, recalculates positions
   - **Resize**: Drag right edge to change duration
   - **Smooth playhead**: Uses requestAnimationFrame for 60fps animation
   - Horizontal scrolling timeline
   - Click to preview chords

## 🎼 Current State

### What Works:
- ✅ Add chords from palette (sequential positioning)
- ✅ Drag chords to move them anywhere on timeline
- ✅ Shift+Drag to reorder chord sequence
- ✅ Resize chord duration
- ✅ Delete individual chords
- ✅ Clear all chords
- ✅ Play/Pause with tempo control (60-180 BPM)
- ✅ Loop playback
- ✅ Smooth linear playhead movement
- ✅ Visual ruler with measures and beats
- ✅ Grid snapping (all positions snap to 8th notes)
- ✅ Click chords to preview sound
- ✅ Piano keyboard works
- ✅ Key/scale selection works

### Data Flow:
```
User clicks chord in palette
  ↓
ChordPalette calculates next position
  ↓
Creates ChordBlock with position/duration in 8th notes
  ↓
Dispatches ADD_CHORD_BLOCK
  ↓
MusicContext updates Song.tracks.chords.blocks
  ↓
ChordTimeline renders positioned blocks
  ↓
useGrid converts 8th notes → pixels for display
```

### Key Files:
- **Data Model**: `src/types/music.ts` - All TypeScript interfaces
- **State**: `src/contexts/MusicContext.tsx` - Song state + actions
- **Grid Logic**: `src/hooks/useGrid.ts` - Time/pixel conversions
- **Timeline**: `src/components/ChordTimeline.tsx` - Main timeline editor
- **Chord Blocks**: `src/components/ChordBlock.tsx` - Individual chord with drag/resize
- **Ruler**: `src/components/Ruler.tsx` - Visual measure/beat display
- **Palette**: `src/components/ChordPalette.tsx` - Chord selection sidebar

## 🚧 What's NOT Done (5 remaining tasks)

### HIGH Priority:
4. **Improve Playback Engine** ⏳
   - Current: Basic setInterval approach
   - Needed: Web Audio API scheduling with lookahead
   - Issue: Not precise enough for complex rhythms

### MEDIUM Priority:
5. **Complete Learn Mode** ⏳
   - Missing: Proper ChordDisplay component
   - Missing: ChordCard with modifier buttons ([7], [maj7], etc.)
   - Current: LearnMode exists but minimal

6. **Add Recording** ⏳
   - Missing: useRecorder() hook
   - Missing: Melody track component
   - Missing: Real-time note recording with quantization

### LOW Priority:
7. **Add Drum Track** ⏳
   - Missing: Step sequencer UI (3x16 grid)
   - Missing: Drum synthesis
   - Missing: Integration with playback

8. **Add Persistence** ⏳
   - Missing: Save/Load functionality
   - Missing: localStorage integration
   - Missing: Song management UI

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor:
- **Playback timing**: Uses setInterval (50ms) - not sample-accurate
- **Overlapping chords**: Can position chords on top of each other (not prevented)
- **No undo/redo**: No history management
- **No visual feedback**: For grid snapping (could show snap lines)

### Not Bugs (By Design):
- Chords can overlap (free positioning)
- No automatic gap filling (manual positioning required)
- Shift key required for reordering (prevents accidental reorders)

## 📋 Next Agent Recommendations

### Immediate Tasks (if continuing on OVERVIEW_PLAN.md):
1. **Task 4**: Improve playback engine
   - Replace setInterval with Web Audio scheduling
   - Add lookahead buffer (100ms)
   - Use AudioContext.currentTime for precise scheduling
   - Add visual feedback during scheduling

2. **Task 5**: Complete Learn Mode
   - Build ChordDisplay grid component
   - Add ChordCard with hover-to-show modifiers
   - Implement chord extensions ([7], [maj7], [9], etc.)
   - Wire up audio preview

### Alternative Focus Areas:
- **Polish existing features**: Add undo/redo, better visual feedback
- **Drum track**: If user wants rhythm section
- **Melody recording**: If user wants melodic input
- **Save/Load**: If user wants to preserve work

### Technical Notes:
- All positions stored in 8th notes (not pixels)
- Grid constants in `useGrid.ts`: `PIXELS_PER_EIGHTH = 20px`
- Time signature changes require grid recalculation
- Playhead updates at 60fps via requestAnimationFrame
- ChordBlocks automatically sort by position after move

## 🎨 UI/UX Notes

### Interaction Model:
- **Default drag**: Move chord to new position
- **Shift + drag**: Reorder chord in sequence
- **Right edge drag**: Resize chord duration
- **Click**: Preview chord sound
- **Delete button**: Remove chord (appears on hover)

### Visual Feedback:
- **Dragging**: 80% opacity, elevated shadow
- **Resizing**: 80% opacity
- **Playing**: Pink gradient, pulse animation
- **Hover**: Elevated shadow, visible controls

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run typecheck    # Type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run build        # Production build
```

## 📝 Code Quality

✅ All TypeScript types defined  
✅ ESLint passing (0 warnings)  
✅ No console errors  
✅ No meta-commentary in code  
✅ Clean data model with single source of truth  
✅ Proper React patterns (hooks, memoization, refs)

**Ready for next phase!** The foundation is solid and extensible.
